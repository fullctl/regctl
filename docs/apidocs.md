# Swagger

A swagger instance is automatically available at the `/docs` endpoint once the server is running. This is a great way to explore the API and test the endpoints.

If running on localhost the swagger instance will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`, assuming the default port of 8000 is used.

# Schema file

Likewise the schema file with be available `/openapi.json` endpoint. This is a json file that describes the API endpoints and their parameters.

If running on localhost the schema file will be available at `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`, assuming the default port of 8000 is used.
